This webapp is currently non-functional.

It includes a login page where verification is handled by an AWS API
and a credit card entry form where card information storage and verification is handeld by a Stripe API.

As this project was completed for a client, the API keys were censored in this public repository.

** WITH THE API KEYS ENTERED, THE WEB-APP IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL **

However, due to legal and privacy reasons, I am unable to display this functionality on a public repository.
